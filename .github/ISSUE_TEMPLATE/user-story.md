**As a** DevOps engineer,
**I want to** deploy our service to the cloud infrastructure,
**so that** it can scale reliably and be accessible to users with high availability and performance. 
   
 ### Details and Assumptions

1. The cloud environment supports autoscaling and load balancing features.
2. The service will be containerized (e.g., using Docker) for ease of deployment.
3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or CloudFormation may be used.

   
 ### Acceptance Criteria  
   
 ```gherkin
Given the service source code is ready for deployment
When the deployment pipeline is triggered
Then the service is deployed to the cloud infrastructure with autoscaling enabled
 ```
